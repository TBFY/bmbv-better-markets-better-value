## Basic Overview

Repository where we will work on the OpenOpps private business case. Free international tender search and alert, contract pipeline, and spend and contract data services with market intelligence. 

**Goals:** The main goal for the BMBV service is to:

• Use transparency to improve public procurement. Without transparency, buyers and companies who are already providing services to government have an unfair advantage in public procurement as they know more about the contracts in place. This results in information asymmetry, a situation that has been proven to be bad for both buyers and suppliers in a market. Improving transparency leads to healthier markets with better value for money.

**Targets:** The main targeted customer segments are:

•	Suppliers who need to know when opportunities are live.

•	Suppliers who want to see 'pipelines' of future opportunities based on contract expiry notices.

**Features:** The main features are:

•	Search tender history.

•	Search for live tenders.

•	Find data on contracts.

•	Spend data.
